# PRD_20250612_1605_reviews_optimistic_updates_performance_fix

## Problem Statement

The Reviews page at https://app.sellersmart.io/reviews has poor user experience due to full table refreshes on every filter change. Additionally, the "Select All" functionality only works for the current page instead of all items globally, and the table includes unnecessary columns (request status, success rate, failed requests) that should be removed for better performance and UX.

## User Needs

1. **Smooth filtering experience**: Users need filters to update instantly without full page refreshes
2. **Global "Select All" functionality**: Users need to select ALL review requests across all pages for bulk operations
3. **Cleaner table interface**: Users need a simplified table without unnecessary status columns
4. **Optimistic updates**: Users need immediate visual feedback when performing actions
5. **Better performance**: Users need faster page load and interaction times

## MCP Tools Used

- **Repomix**: Analyzed SellerSmart-Web codebase structure, identified table patterns, optimistic update implementations, and existing filter mechanisms
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Analyzed reviews collection schema, identified redundant fields, and understanding data structure for optimizations
- **Task Agent**: Deep-dive analysis of current table behavior, SSE patterns, and existing optimistic update examples in the codebase

## Test Specifications (TDD)

### Test Scenarios

1. **Optimistic Filter Updates**
   - Given: User is on reviews page with loaded data
   - When: User changes a filter (status, date range, search)
   - Then: UI updates immediately, no loading spinner, data filters correctly

2. **Global Select All Functionality**
   - Given: User has multiple pages of review requests (>20 items)
   - When: User clicks "Select All" button
   - Then: All items across ALL pages are selected, bulk actions affect global selection

3. **Optimistic Bulk Operations**
   - Given: User has selected multiple review requests globally
   - When: User performs a bulk action (delete, status change)
   - Then: UI updates immediately, changes persist after API confirmation

4. **Client-side Pagination**
   - Given: User has filtered data loaded locally
   - When: User navigates between pages
   - Then: Pagination is instant, no API calls for page changes

5. **Filter State Persistence**
   - Given: User has applied multiple filters
   - When: User refreshes page or navigates away and back
   - Then: Filter state is restored from URL or localStorage

6. **Error Handling and Rollback**
   - Given: User performs an optimistic action
   - When: API call fails or network error occurs
   - Then: UI reverts to previous state, error message shown

## Codebase Analysis

### Current Implementation Issues

**Reviews Page** (`/src/app/reviews/page.tsx:44854`):
- Filter changes trigger full `fetchReviewsData()` calls
- Selection state only tracks current page items
- Server-side pagination requires API calls for each page change
- All filtering is server-side, causing unnecessary round trips

**API Inefficiencies** (`/api/amazon/reviews`):
- Returns paginated results that require multiple calls for global operations
- Includes unused fields: request_status, success_rate, failed_requests
- No bulk operation endpoints for global actions

### Existing Patterns to Follow

**Successful Optimistic Update Pattern** (from `/src/components/features/inventory/CostInputColumn.tsx`):
```tsx
// Immediate UI update
await onUpdate(item._id, newValue);

try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/inventory/${item._id}/update`, {
        method: "PUT",
        body: JSON.stringify(newValue)
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Update failed");
} catch (error) {
    // Rollback on failure
    await onUpdate(item._id, originalValue);
}
```

**Client-side Filtering Pattern** (from `/src/components/features/rivalradar/RadarView.tsx`):
```tsx
const filteredItems = useMemo(() => {
    return items.filter((item) => {
        const matchesFilter = filters.status === "ALL" || item.status === filters.status;
        return matchesFilter && item.name.includes(searchTerm);
    });
}, [items, filters, searchTerm]);
```

**SSE Integration Pattern** (from `/src/app/inventory/data/client.tsx`):
```tsx
setData((prevData) => {
    const existingIndex = prevData.items.findIndex(item => item._id === updatedItem._id);
    if (existingIndex >= 0) {
        updatedItems[existingIndex] = updatedItem;
    }
    return { ...prevData, items: updatedItems };
});
```

### Reusable Components and Utilities

- **`TanStackTableWrapper`**: Base table with column management
- **`StandardPagination`**: Pagination controls (modify for client-side)
- **`UnifiedSocketContext`**: Real-time updates via SSE
- **`useGlobalLayoutManager`**: Column visibility and sizing
- **Filter dropdown patterns**: From other features for consistency

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Client-side Data Management

**New Custom Hook: `useOptimisticReviews`**
```tsx
interface UseOptimisticReviewsReturn {
    data: ReviewRequest[];
    isLoading: boolean;
    error: Error | null;
    filters: ReviewFilters;
    pagination: PaginationState;
    selectedItems: Set<string>;
    actions: {
        updateFilters: (filters: Partial<ReviewFilters>) => void;
        selectItem: (id: string) => void;
        selectAll: () => void;
        clearSelection: () => void;
        bulkUpdate: (action: BulkAction, ids: string[]) => Promise<void>;
        refreshData: () => Promise<void>;
    };
}
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Load all relevant data on initial page load (with pagination for very large datasets)
- Store complete dataset in React state for client-side operations
- Use `useMemo` for filtering and sorting operations
- Implement debounced API synchronization for filter changes

### 2. API Endpoint Modifications

**Optimize `/api/amazon/reviews` endpoint:**
- Add `include_all=true` parameter to fetch complete dataset for optimization
- Remove unused fields: `request_status`, `success_rate`, `failed_requests`
- Add response caching headers for better performance
- Implement data compression for large responses

**New endpoint: `/api/amazon/reviews/bulk-action`**
```tsx
POST /api/amazon/reviews/bulk-action
{
    action: "delete" | "update_status" | "resend",
    item_ids: string[],
    params?: { status?: string, notes?: string }
}
```

### 3. Database Schema Updates

**Reviews Collection Changes:**
- Remove or exclude unused tracking fields in queries
- Add compound indexes for optimized filtering:
  - `{ user_id: 1, asin: 1, "review_requests.status": 1 }`
  - `{ user_id: 1, seller_id: 1, "review_requests.request_date": 1 }`

### 4. State Management Architecture

**Global Selection State:**
```tsx
interface GlobalSelectionState {
    selectedIds: Set<string>;
    isAllSelected: boolean;
    totalCount: number;
    filteredCount: number;
    actions: {
        selectItem: (id: string) => void;
        deselectItem: (id: string) => void;
        selectAll: () => void;
        clearAll: () => void;
        toggleItem: (id: string) => void;
    };
}
```

**Filter State Management:**
- URL-based filter persistence using Next.js searchParams
- localStorage backup for complex filter states
- Debounced API sync for server-side data consistency

### 5. Performance Optimizations

**Virtual Scrolling** (for large datasets):
- Implement with `@tanstack/react-virtual` if dataset >1000 items
- Maintain selection state during virtual scrolling

**Memoization Strategy:**
- Memoize filtered data calculations
- Memoize table column configurations
- Use React.memo for table row components

**Bundle Optimization:**
- Code-split optimistic update logic
- Lazy load bulk operation components
- Implement service worker for offline state management
