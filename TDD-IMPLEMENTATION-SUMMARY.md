# TDD Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Backups
All original scripts backed up to `/scripts/backups/`:
- `create-prd.sh.backup`
- `execute-prd.sh.backup`
- `streamdeck-create-prd.sh.backup`
- `streamdeck-execute-prd.sh.backup`

### 2. Updated Scripts

#### create-prd.sh
- Added TDD requirements to the Claude prompt
- Added test planning phase to workflow
- Added test specifications section to PRD structure
- Added test-related items to codebase exploration checklist
- Added TDD verification to completion steps

#### execute-prd.sh
- Restructured execution into 4 TDD phases:
  1. Write Tests First (no implementation)
  2. Implement with TDD Cycle
  3. Quality Assurance
  4. Completion
- Added test commands for each service type
- Added strict TDD rules enforcement
- Updated output messages to reflect TDD workflow

### 3. Created Documentation

#### TDD-GUIDELINES.md
Comprehensive guide covering:
- TDD workflow (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Coverage requirements (100% target)
- Test types and best practices
- Service-specific commands
- Examples and patterns

#### PRD-TEMPLATE-TDD.md
Template for new PRDs including:
- Test specifications section
- Test scenarios format
- Coverage targets
- TDD-ordered implementation checklist

#### TDD-QUICK-REFERENCE.md
Quick command reference for:
- Running tests by service type
- Coverage commands
- Debugging tests
- CI/CD integration

## Usage

### Creating a PRD (Stream Deck or CLI)
```bash
# Stream Deck: Press "Architect Create" button
# CLI: ./scripts/create-prd.sh
```

The PRD creation will now:
- Prompt for test specifications
- Require test scenarios before implementation details
- Include coverage targets in the PRD

### Executing a PRD (Stream Deck or CLI)
```bash
# Stream Deck: Press "Architect Execute" button
# CLI: ./scripts/execute-prd.sh PRD_ID
```

The execution will now:
1. Force writing all tests first
2. Verify tests fail before implementation
3. Guide through TDD cycle for each feature
4. Enforce 100% coverage requirement

## Key Benefits

1. **Quality Assurance**: Bugs caught early through failing tests
2. **Confidence**: 100% coverage ensures all code is tested
3. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
4. **Refactoring Safety**: Can refactor with confidence
5. **Design Improvement**: TDD forces better API design

## Next Steps

1. Team training on TDD workflow
2. Update CI/CD to enforce coverage thresholds
3. Create test utilities and helpers
4. Document testing patterns specific to SellerSmart
